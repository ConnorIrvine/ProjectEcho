# Motorized Prosthetic For Driving An Automatic Vehicle

## Project Summary

Hand amputees that wish to drive a vehicle use a combination of driving aids, often requiring modification of their vehicles. We designed and developed a motorized prosthetic with the goal of removing the need for hand amputees to modify their vehicle in order to drive. 
The prosthetic, consisting of a clamp mechanism, can be opened with a servo motor triggered by an EMG signal from the user. Validation was performed to determine the prototypeâ€™s viability; the prototype is capable of gripping a wheel and assisting rotation.
