# ProjectEcho

Our chosen user population is 25- to 40-year-old hand amputees (specifically those missing the left hand), in Ontario, with a driver's license; our chosen task is driving. Products exist for one-handed driving, such as "knob grips" for assisted steering and modifications to the gear shifter and secondary controls (e.g., turn signals). Some one-handed drivers may choose to use prosthetics to aid driving (or a combination of a prosthetic and car-modifications). 

Our goal is to create a motorized prosthetic that allows a user to drive a car without additional car-modifications; the prosthetic shall be able to grip/un-grip the wheel via EMG signal. The user, then, shall be able to utilize their turn signals, headlight controls, horn, and potentially steering-wheel-buttons while driving.
