# ADDING CODE

1. ``Git checkout main``
2. ``Git pull``
3. ``Git checkout -b your_branch_name``
4. Make your changes
5. Stage your changes using VSCode built in source control
    a. Open Source Control
    b. Select the plus for each file you want to commit
6. ``Git commit -m "your_message_here"``
7. ``Git push`` OR if it is your first time pushing ``Git push origin/your_branch_name``

Friendly note please prefix all commit messages with **fix:** or **feat:** depending on if what you are doing constitutes a new feature or a fixture of existing code or logic. Another friendly reminder that you need to save your files before staging/commiting using *Ctrl + S* in VSCODE.
